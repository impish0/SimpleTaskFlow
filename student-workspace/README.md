# 🎓 Student Learning Workspace

**Welcome to your coding journey!** This is where you'll build your own task manager application from scratch, following the step-by-step curriculum.

## 🎯 What Happens Here

This folder is **your workspace** where you'll:
- Create your own version of the task manager
- Follow the curriculum modules step-by-step  
- Build confidence through hands-on coding
- Have a place to experiment and make mistakes safely

## 🚀 Getting Started

### ⚠️ First Time Here? Install Tools First!

**If you haven't installed Node.js, Git, and VS Code yet:**

👉 **[Go to Module 1 for tool installation](../curriculum/module-1/README.md)**

The module will guide you through installing everything you need.

### ✅ Already Have Tools Installed? 

**Verify your tools are working:**

Open your terminal/command prompt and check:

```bash
node --version    # Should show v18+ 
npm --version     # Should show 9+
git --version     # Should show 2.0+
code --version    # Should show VS Code version
```

**If all commands work, you're ready to continue with Module 1!**

### Step 1: Start With Module 1

Navigate to the curriculum and begin your journey:

```bash
# From this directory (student-workspace)
cd ../curriculum/module-1/
```

Open the `README.md` file in that folder and follow every step carefully.

**💡 Pro Tip:** You can also open the curriculum in VS Code:
```bash
code ../curriculum/module-1/README.md
```

### Step 2: Build Your Project Here

The curriculum will guide you to create your project structure in this workspace:

```bash
# You'll eventually have something like this:
student-workspace/
├── my-task-manager/         # Your project (created in Module 1)
│   ├── client/             # Frontend you'll build
│   ├── server/             # Backend you'll build
│   ├── package.json        # Project configuration
│   └── README.md           # Your project documentation
└── README.md               # This file
```

## 🎯 Learning Philosophy

### Don't Worry About Making Mistakes!

This workspace is **yours to experiment in**. You can:
- ❌ Break things and learn from errors
- 🔄 Start over if needed (it's just practice!)
- 🧪 Try different approaches
- 💡 Ask questions and get help from your Claude tutor

### Get Help When Stuck

**Your Claude tutor is here to help!** When you run into problems:
1. **Read the error message carefully** - what does it say?
2. **Check which step you're on** - are you following the module exactly?
3. **Ask specific questions** - "I'm on Step 5 of Module 2 and getting this error: [paste error]"
4. **Compare with the reference** - look at `../reference-implementation/` if really stuck

## 📚 Curriculum Navigation

**Module 1:** [`../curriculum/module-1/README.md`](../curriculum/module-1/README.md)
- Environment setup
- Git workflow  
- Project structure

**Module 2:** [`../curriculum/module-2/README.md`](../curriculum/module-2/README.md)
- Database design
- Prisma setup
- Schema creation

**Module 3+:** Continue through the modules in order!

## 🆘 When You Need Help

### Check the Reference Implementation

If you're completely stuck, you can look at the complete working code:

```bash
cd ../reference-implementation
```

**But remember:** The goal is to build it yourself! Use the reference to:
- See what the final result should look like
- Compare your code when debugging
- Understand how pieces fit together

### Ask Your Claude Tutor

When asking for help, be specific:
- ✅ "I'm on Step 7 of Module 2, and when I run `npm run db:seed` I get this error: [paste full error]"
- ❌ "It's not working"

- ✅ "I created the schema file but Prisma Studio shows no tables"
- ❌ "Database stuff is broken"

## 🎉 Celebrate Your Progress!

After each module:
- ✅ Check off completed items in the module checklist
- 🎯 Make sure you can explain what you built
- 💪 Commit your code to Git (the modules will teach you how!)
- 🚀 Move on to the next module with confidence

## 🏆 Your Goals

By the end of this curriculum, you'll have:
- **Built a complete web application** from scratch
- **Learned professional development practices** 
- **Gained confidence** to tackle new coding challenges
- **Created a portfolio project** you can show to employers
- **Understood how modern web development works**
